# Achtung, die Kurve! in JavaScript

The aim of this project is to create a HTML5/JS remake of the original *Achtung, die Kurve!* from 1995.


## Play

Open `zatacka.html` in a browser to run the game.


## Contribute

All actual code can be found in `zatacka.js`. The `scripts` folder contains some libraries that the game uses, but those will probably never be modified.

Everything that happens in the black area is drawn on a canvas. `zatacka.html` and `zatacka.css` provide the scoreboard, chrome, alignment, and scaling.
